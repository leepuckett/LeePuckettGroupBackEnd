##  This is my class project for *Code Louisville's Fall 2017 C# course*. 
##*"Lee Puckett Music"* is a web page for my musical projects,  
featuring information about my band, photos, a songlist, and contact information. 
The *contact* page includes an email link. The *songlist* page includes a zoomable song list and the screen adjusts for different screen sizes.  The *guestbook* features a form for visitors to fillout, including name and city, which can be edited or deleted.
###  This project makes use of the *MVC framework*.
#### To download this project, the only requirement is that you have *visual studio*. VS 2017 was used for this project.
