##  This is my class project for **Code Louisville**'s Fall 2017 C# course. 
## *"Lee Puckett Music"* is a web page for my musical projects,  
featuring information about my band, photos, a songlist, and contact information. 
The *contact* page includes an email link.  The *guestbook* features a form for visitors to fillout, including name and city, which can be edited or deleted. Guestbook will allow Lee Puckett Music who their fans are and where thye are located to inform tour planning.
###  This project makes use of the *MVC framework*.
#### To download this project, the only requirement is that you have *visual studio*. VS 2017 was used for this project.
