# LeePuckettGroupBackEnd
This is my class project for Code Louisville's Fall 2017 C# course. "Lee Puckett Music" is a web page for my musical projects,  
featuring information about my band, photos, a songlist, and contact information. 
The contact page includes an email link. The songlist page includes a zoomable song list and the screen adjusts for different screen sizes.  The guestbook features a form for visitors to fillout, including name and city.
